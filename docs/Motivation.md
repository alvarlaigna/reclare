## Motivation

Early in the days of modern front-end development, before the frameworks got popular, people were building user interfaces by manipulating the DOM manipulation, using either vanilla javascript or the all-famous jQuery. It was reasonable then - as front-end applications were simple and not as data-driven. 

[Redux](https://redux.js.org) pioneered the way of making immutability and predictability in state management a standard in modern front-end applications. It restricted how and when an application state can update, making bugs visible and reproducible regardless of the complexity of the application.
